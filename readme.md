Cat Curling!

For this projects I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JQuery DOM minipulation.

The approach I took for this game, all started out from this youTube video:

In a way, it is like hitting darts on a target. Except the darts are cats.
Challenges = finally understanng collision detection and getting it to work not just for one cat, but for ALL THREE!!!

Unsolved problem: the "whatCat" is somehow 2 points when it should be one. It was solved by creating another if statement within an if statement. (This isnt correct code, but it works for now).

Since the collision detection is at specific points on the web page, responsiveness is not available. In order to play, you must be on a desktop, and using full screen.
