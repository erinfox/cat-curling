Cat Curling!! 

For this projects I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JQuery DOM minipulation. 

The approach I took for this game, all started out from this youTube video:

In a way, it is like hitting darts on a target. Except the darts are cats. 
Challenges = finally understanng collision detection and getting it to work not just for one cat, but for ALL THREE!!! 

Unsolved problem: the "whatCat" is somehow 2 points when it should be one. Stacey helped me solve this issue by creating another if statement within an if statement. 

I struggled a lot and spent too much time on scopping issues. A missing { or ( drove me crazy. I need to find a better way to layout my code so this isnt an issue in the future.
