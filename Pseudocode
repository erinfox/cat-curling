Game Goal = launch the cat and slow the cat speed down so it lands on the target
Landing on the target = YOU WIN
Not landing on the target = TRY AGAIN


-Show the rules accross the screen in a window-
1. Click start button
2. Cat will launch straight across the screen toward the target at one quick speed
3. Slow the cat speed down by clicking the sweep/slow button
4. once landing the stopped cat on the target, YOU WIN.
5. If the cat is not on the target, TRY AGAIN.




HELP

make the SLOW DOWN button decrease speed amount everytime it's clicked until it's stopped
make collision detection work when cat is stoped over the target
git rid of scroll bar / make cnavas
